This is a simple Golang library implementing the XML structure for the [CCTray v1 Specification Standard](https://cctray.org/v1/).

This was originally forked from of [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone/blob/f276bc10366a3389d460a8b8903bc5fdfbe0d6c8/model/cc.go) while the component was still Apache licened. It was forked with the aim of having a more reusable implementation.

## Tools that use the CCTray v1 Standard
